## Architecture

The overall architecture of aspera-cli is modular and extensible.

![Architecture](docs/architecture.png)

Structure Highlights:

- Entry Point:

  `lib/aspera/cli/main.rb` - This is where the CLI execution begins.

- Plugins:

  Located in `lib/aspera/cli/plugins`, plugins extend CLI functionality and encapsulate specific features.

- Transfer Agents:

  Found in `lib/aspera/agent`, these handle data transfers operations.

A list of classes are provided in <docs/uml.png>

## Ruby version

`aspera-cli` is built with Ruby.
You can install Ruby using any method you prefer (e.g., rbenv, rvm, system package manager).

To start with a clean slate and remove all installed gems:

```bash
make clean_gems
```

> [!TIP]
> This is especially useful before testing across different Ruby versions or preparing for a release.

## Tool chain

TODO: document installation of tool chain.

Build system uses GNU Make.

### Environment

A few macros/env vars control some aspects:

| `make` macro or Env var     | Description                          |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `ASPERA_CLI_TEST_CONF_FILE` | Path to configuration file with secrets for tests |
| `ASPERA_CLI_TEST_MACOS`     | Set to `true` if local HSTS running on macOS      |
| `ASPERA_CLI_TEST_PRIVATE`   | Path to private folder               |
| `ASPERA_CLI_DOC_CHECK_LINKS`| Check links still exist during doc generation.    |
| `ASPERA_CLI_DOC_DEBUG`      | Enable debug in doc generation.      |
| `ENABLE_COVERAGE`           | Tests with coverage analysis if set. |
| `SIGNING_KEY`               | Path to signing key to build Gem.    |
| `GEM_VERSION`               | Gem version to build container       |

Those macros can be set either in an env var, or on the `make` command line.

> **Note:** Env vars `ASPERA_CLI_TEST_` are typically set in user's shell profile for development.
Others are more for "one shot" use.

To use the CLI directly from the development environment, add this to your shell profile:

```bash
dev_ascli=$HOME/github/aspera-cli
export PATH=$dev_ascli/bin:$PATH
export RUBYLIB=$dev_ascli/lib:$RUBYLIB
```

### Documentation

Documentation is generated with `pandoc` and `LaTeX`.

IBM font `Plex` is used, for installation see [IBM Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/).

On macOS to install `lualatex` and all packages:

```bash
brew install texlive
```

If `lualatex` is installed using another method, ensure that the following packages are installed:

```bash
tlmgr update --self
tlmgr install fvextra selnolig lualatex-math
```

To check URL during doc generation, set env var: `ASPERA_CLI_DOC_CHECK_LINKS=1`.

To debug doc generation, set env var: `ASPERA_CLI_DOC_DEBUG=debug`.

## Running Tests

First, a testing configuration file must be created.
From project top folder, execute:

```bash
mkdir ~/some_secure_folder
cp docs/test_env.conf ~/some_secure_folder/.
```

Fill `~/some_secure_folder/test_env.conf` with system URLs and credentials for tests.

Then, tell where this file is located:

```bash
export ASPERA_CLI_TEST_CONF_FILE=~/some_secure_folder/test_env.conf
```

This project uses a `Makefile` for tests, in main folder:

```bash
make test
```

When new commands are added to the CLI, new tests shall be added to the test suite in `tests/Makefile`.

One can also go to the `tests` folder:

```bash
cd tests
make
make full
make list
make torc
make skip_torc
make skip T=orch_wizard
```

### Special tests

Some gems are optional: `rmagick` and `grpc`, as they require compilation of native code which may cause problems.
By default, tests that use those gems are skipped.
To run them: `make optional`.
Those tests also require the optional gems to be installed: `make install_optional_gems`.

Some other tests require interactive input. To run them: `make interactive`

To run every test: `make full`

### Pre-release tests

For preparation of a release, do the following:

1. Select a ruby version to test with.
2. Remove all gems: `make clean_gems`
3. `cd tests && make full`

To test additional Ruby version, repeat the procedure with other Ruby versions.

## Coverage

A coverage report can be generated in folder `coverage` using gem `SimpleCov`.
Enable coverage monitoring using macro/envvar `ENABLE_COVERAGE`.

```bash
cd tests
make ENABLE_COVERAGE=1
```

Once tests are completed, or during test, consult the page: [coverage/index.html](coverage/index.html)

## Build

By default, the gem is built signed: `make`.
A private key is required to generate a signed Gem.
Its path must be set using macro/envvar `SIGNING_KEY`, see below.
The gem is signed with the public certificate found in `certs` and the private key (kept secret by maintainer).

```bash
make SIGNING_KEY=/path/to/vault/gem-private_key.pem
```

It is also possible to build an unsigned version for development purpose: `make unsigned_gem`.

### Gem Signature

Refer to <certs/README.md>

### gRPC stubs for transfer SDK

Update with:

```bash
make grpc
```

It downloads the latest proto file and then compiles it.

## Container image build

See [Container build](./container/README.md).

For operations, move to the folder:

```bash
cd container
```

## Single executable build

See [Executable build](./binary/README.md).

For operations, move to the folder:

```bash
cd binary
```

## Development check list for new release

When preparing for a new release do the following:

- TODO

## Long Term Implementation and delivery improvements

- replace Rest and OAuth classes with ruby standard gems:
  - <https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client>
  - <https://github.com/oauth-xx/oauth2>
- use gem Thor <http://whatisthor.com/> (or other standard Ruby CLI manager)
- look at <https://github.com/phusion/traveling-ruby>
