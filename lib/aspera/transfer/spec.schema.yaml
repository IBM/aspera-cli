  move_after_transfer:
    description: >-
      Move source files to the specified `archive-dir` directory after they are transferred correctly.

      Available as of 3.8.0.
      Details in ascp manual.

      Requires write permissions on the source.

      If `src_base` is specified, files are moved to `archive-dir`/`path-relative-to-srcbase`.

      `archive-dir` must be in the same file system (or cloud storage account) as the source files being transferred.

      `archive-dir` is subject to the same docroot restrictions as source files.

      `move_after_transfer` and `remove_after_transfer` are mutually exclusive options.

      After files have been moved to the archive, the original source directory structure is left in place.
      Empty directories are not saved to `archive-dir`.
      To remove empty source directories after a successful move operation, also set `remove_empty_directories` to `true`.
      When using `remove_empty_directories`, empty directory removal examination starts at the `srcbase` and proceeds down any subdirectories.
      If no `srcbase` is used and a file path (as opposed to a directory path) is specified, then only the immediate parent directory is examined and removed if it is empty following the move of the source file.

  overwrite:
    description: >-
      Overwrite files at the destination with source files of the same name based 
      on the policy:

      - `always` : Always overwrite the file.

      - `never` : Never overwrite the file.
      If the destination contains partial files that are older or the same 
      as the source files and resume is enabled, the partial files resume transfer.
      Partial files with checksums or sizes that differ from the source files 
      are not overwritten.

      - `diff` : (default) Overwrite the file if it is different from the source, 
      depending on the compare method (default is size).
      If the destination is object storage, `diff` has the same effect as always.
      If resume is not enabled, partial files are overwritten if they are different 
      from the source, otherwise they are skipped.
      If resume is enabled, only partial files with different sizes or checksums 
      from the source are overwritten; otherwise, files resume.

      - `diff+older` : Overwrite the file if it is older and different from the source, 
      depending on the compare method (default is size).
      If resume is not enabled, partial files are overwritten if they are older 
      and different from the source, otherwise they are skipped.
      If resume is enabled, only partial files that are different and older than 
      the source are overwritten, otherwise they are resumed.

      - `older` : Overwrite the file if its timestamp is older than the source timestamp.

      If you set an overwrite policy of `diff` or `diff+older`, difference is determined 
      by the value set for `resume_policy`:

      `none` : The source and destination files are always considered different and 
      the destination file is always overwritten

      `attributes` : The source and destination files are compared based on file attributes 

      `sparse_checksum` : The source and destination files are compared based on sparse checksums, (currently file size)

      `full_checksum` : The source and destination files are compared based on full checksums
